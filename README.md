1. Railway Reservation System

	The Railway Reservation System is designed to efficiently handle the operations of booking, scheduling, and managing train journeys. In this system:

SQL is used extensively to create and manage relational tables for users, passengers, train details, stations, and bookings.

SQL queries enable efficient data retrieval for train schedules, passenger lists, and availability of seats.

Complex SQL joins link tables such as train_details, stations, and journey to provide real-time information for bookings and routes.

SQL ensures data consistency, integrity (through constraints like PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY), and security for sensitive data like user login credentials and payment details.

2. Hospital Management System (HMS)

	The Hospital Management System is structured to streamline hospital operations, including patient care, staff management, and inventory control. SQL plays a key role in this system:

SQL manages databases for patient records, doctor schedules, appointments, and billing.

Stored procedures and triggers help automate processes like updating patient history after each appointment or generating bills after treatment.

SQL handles data integrity by ensuring that patient records are updated consistently, and no medical or billing details are lost or duplicated.

SQL queries allow fast retrieval of critical data such as patient diagnoses, medication inventories, and doctor availability, making hospital operations smoother and more reliable.

In both systems, SQL forms the backbone of efficient data management, ensuring structured storage, quick retrieval, and secure handling of sensitive information.
